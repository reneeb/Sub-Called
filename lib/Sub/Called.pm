=head1 SYNOPSIS


    use Sub::Called;
    
    sub test {
        if( Sub::Called::with_ampersand() ){
            print "you called this subroutine this way: &test\n",
                  "note that this disables prototypes!\n";
        }
    }


    use Sub::Called 'already_called', 'not_called';
    
    sub user {
        unless (already_called) {   # only gets called once
            My::Fixtures::Users->load;
        }
        ...
    }
    
    sub schema {
        if ( not_called ) {
            # setup schema
        }
        else {
            return $schema;
        }
    }

=head1 EXPORTS

There are no subroutines exported by default, but you can export all subroutines
explicitly

  use Sub::Called qw(with_ampersand already_called not_called);

=head2 C<already_called>

This function must be called from inside a subroutine.  It will return false
if the subroutine has not yet been called.  It will only return false once.

This subroutine is only exported on demand.

=head2 C<not_called>

This function must be called from inside a subroutine.  It returns the
opposite value of C<already_called>.  Aside from this, there is no difference.
You may find aesthetically more pleasing.

This subroutine is only exported on demand.

=head2 C<with_ampersand>

This function must be called from inside a subroutine. It returns 1 if the subroutine
was called with an ampersand (e.g. C<&subroutine()>).

This subroutine is only exported on demand.

=head1 LIMITATIONS / TODO

There are limitations and I don't know if I can solve these "problems".
So this section is also named "TODO". If you know a solution for any
of these limitations, please let me know.

=head2 Subroutine References

It seems that there are some problems with subroutine references.

This may not work:

  sub test2 {
      if( Sub::Called::with_ampersand() ){
          die "die hard";
      }
  };
    
  my $sub2 = main->can( 'test2' );
  &$sub2();

=head2 Inside a module

If you call subroutines in a module but outside any subroutine (so
the subroutine calls are executed when the module is loaded), I cannot
give a correct answer ;-)

  package Check;
  
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use Sub::Called qw(with_ampersand);
  
  &test;
  
  sub test {
      if( with_ampersand() ){
          print "yada yada yada\n";
      }
  }
